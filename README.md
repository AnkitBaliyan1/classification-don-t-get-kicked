# Auction Bad Buy Classification Model

## Overview

This project involves the development of a classification model to predict whether a buy at an auction is a bad buy or not. The dataset used for this task is highly imbalanced, making it a challenging problem to address. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), etc., have been employed to build the classification model. Additionally, techniques such as grid search and randomized grid search have been used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of these models. Both oversampling and undersampling methods have been experimented with to achieve an optimum model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the classification model. It includes both the feature matrix (X) and the target variable (y).

2. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the different stages of the project, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The notebooks are organized as follows:
   
   - **01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**: Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   
   - **02_Model_Training.ipynb**: Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. Different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) are implemented and evaluated.

   - **03_Model_Evaluation.ipynb**: Model evaluation, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Visualizations of results are also provided.

3. **Scripts**: This directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. These scripts can be used for batch processing or automation of specific tasks.

4. **Results**: This directory contains saved model files, evaluation metrics, and visualizations generated during the project. It provides a reference for the best-performing models.

5. **Requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project successfully. You can create a virtual environment and install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. **README.md**: This README file that you are currently reading provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the project structure.

## Important Notes

- Model performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, have been carefully considered due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. Depending on the specific problem requirements, you may prioritize certain metrics over others.

- The choice of oversampling or undersampling techniques can significantly impact model performance. It's essential to experiment with different approaches and select the one that best suits your problem.

- The hyperparameters of the models have been fine-tuned using techniques like grid search and randomized grid search. You can further refine the model by exploring additional hyperparameter combinations.

- Keep in mind that this project is for educational and exploratory purposes. Before deploying the model in a real-world scenario, extensive testing and validation are necessary.
